# SenseTemp

This project provides a simple and easy-to-use way to monitor the temperature and humidity using a Raspberry Pi and the Sense HAT add-on board. The project includes a VNC server so that you can remotely access the Raspberry Pi's desktop and view the temperature and humidity readings in real-time.

### Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (tested on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B)
- Sense HAT add-on board
- Python 3.x
- VNC Server

### Installation

### Features
- Real-time temperature and humidity readings using the Sense HAT
- Ability to set up notifications if the temperature or humidity goes beyond a certain threshold

### Usage
Once you have set up the program and VNC server, you can simply access the Raspberry Pi's desktop using the VNC viewer and view the temperature and humidity readings in real-time. You can also set up notifications if the temperature or humidity goes beyond a certain threshold by using the settings menu in the GUI.
